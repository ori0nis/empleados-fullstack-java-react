## Welcome to Sistema de Recursos Humanos, my second fullstack project featuring Java, Springboot and React! 🚀

Sistema de Recursos Humanos is my very first attempt at React programming. It's a very simple web app that manages employees that are allocated in an SQL database, and serves them using Springboot, JPA and React, with HTTP requests done through Axios.

This project has made me see how much I love Angular/React programming and I've decided to make learning both my priority from now on.
